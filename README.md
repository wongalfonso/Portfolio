# Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio built with React/Redux. The reason why Redux is being used is because this project has Mongo installed using MLabs allowing me to perform basic CRUD operations on a personal Blog. 

##Installing
  ```
  npm install
  run MongoD
  ```

###Deployment
  ```
  deployed using heroku for development and AWS for production
  ```
