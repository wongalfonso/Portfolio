# Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio built with React/Redux. The reason why Redux is being used is because this project contains Mongo using MLabs,allowing me to perform basic CRUD operations on a personal Blog. 

## Installing
  ```
  npm install
  ```
## Start 
  ```
  run MongoD in terminal
  npm start for production
  npm run dev && npm run server for dev
  ```
### Deployment
  ```
  Deployed using Heroku for development and AWS for production
  ```
### Notes
  ```
  Running bcrypt, currently there is a dependency that has vulnerabilities for an older version. Version 3.0.0 works fine but you need node@10.6.0
  ```
