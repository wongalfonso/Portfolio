# Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio built with React/Redux. The reason why Redux is being used is because this project contains Mongo using MLabs,allowing me to perform basic CRUD operations on a personal Blog. 

## Installing
  ```
  npm install
  run MongoD
  ```

### Deployment
  ```
  Deployed using Heroku for development and AWS for production
  ```
